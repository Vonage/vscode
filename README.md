# Vonage VS Code

A Visual Studio Code extension for accessing the Vonage communication APIs.




## Telemetry

The Vonage VS Code Extension collects basic telemetry in order to improve this
extension's experience. If you'd like to opt out we respect the global telemetry
setting in VS Code, so we won't collect any data unless this setting is turned on.
